## Description and objective

The original Zalando dataset contains 10 different labels:

0. __T-shirt/top__
1. __Trouser__
2. __Pullover__
3. __Dress__
4. __Coat__
5. __Sandal__
6. __Shirt__
7. __Sneaker__
8. __Bag__
9. __Ankle boot__

In this case, we want to group the original labels in 5 new labels with the following mapping between them:

* __Upper part__: T-shirt/top + Pullover + Coat + Shirt Bottom part: Trouser
* __One piece__: Dress
* __Footwear__: Sandal + Sneaker + Ankle boot Bags: Bag


The goal of this exercise is to understand the dataset and experiment with deep learning techniques to train a classifier for the given grouped classes (Upper part, Bottom Part, One piece, Footwear and Bags).

## Data Understanding and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of:
* __A training set of 60,000 examples__
* __A test set of 10,000 examples__
* It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

2. Image size: __28x28__
3. Image type: __grayscale image__
